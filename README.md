Here is a sample description for your "Discord-Guilds-Clone" project:

### Discord Guilds Clone

This project is a clone of the Discord guilds (servers) functionality. It aims to replicate the core features of Discord's server management, including:

- Creating and managing multiple servers
- User roles and permissions
- Channels (text, voice)
- Message handling and moderation
- Real-time updates with WebSocket integration
- Integration with third-party services and bots

This repository is intended for educational purposes and is a great starting point for anyone looking to understand the inner workings of a complex, real-time chat application like Discord.

Feel free to contribute and enhance this project!
